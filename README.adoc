Automated installation and configuration of the logging stack for application logging

== Goal

* satisfy the ticket https://github.com/gepaplexx/docs/issues/27[#27 Cluster Logging for Applications]

* learn what you need to know in addition to the available docs

== Starting Point

* we have a running cluster

* we have a service machine to run kubectl, oc, ansible, helm, etc

* we have the official  https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/logging/cluster-logging.html[docs]

* we have a storage class/provisioner taking away the headache of pv/pvc 

== Do it by hand

The first step of installing and deploying the cluster logging operator and the EFK stack is fairly simple. +
We can run it by hand once. +
Then we automate it.
